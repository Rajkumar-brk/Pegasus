### Attendance Management System 

The objective of the student attendance management system is to reduce the time that is consumed when attendance is taken manually. 
Unlike the manual process, an online system easily helps management to analyse studentâ€™s attendance details as per requirement.

A detailed summary of student attendance history can be obtained in an instant.
